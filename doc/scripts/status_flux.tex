Dark green lines represent events where the fitted slope was positive but not significant. Empty panels for Gingin, Whroo and Wombat State Forest indicates that we did not find any concomitant positive GPP and negative LE slopes. Note in both cases, we are not showing the fitted slopes, we simply use this approach to identify stronger positive or negative trends in these data (see methods). Events where the fitted slope was negative are shown in Figure 1.}}
